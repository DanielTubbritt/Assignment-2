                    My main interst at the moment would propably be going to Austrailia to visit my long distance
                    girlfriend, though this endevour will take time I am excited.

                    My next two hobbies go hand in hand, I want to travell the world and explore what it has to offer
                    before settling in one place, I want to visit places such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
                    Iceland, Japan and so many others.

                <p>
                    I really enjoy camping and would like to camp in so many locations around the world, I would like to
                    go back packing across Europe for six months.
